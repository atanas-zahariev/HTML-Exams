                            that, but great minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too.</p>

                        <p>Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct
                            individual accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows
                            common people to attain uncommon results. Individual commitment to a group effortâ€”that is
                            what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilisation work.</p>
